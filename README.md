# Building-LLMs-from-scratch
A hands-on project demonstrating the development of a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch using Python and deep learning frameworks. This repository includes data preprocessing, model architecture design, training loops, tokenization, attention mechanisms, and evaluation. Ideal for learning the inner working of transformer-based language models
